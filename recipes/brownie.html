        <p>This simple, fudgy brownies recipe might be the best you have ever tried. <br>
             Fattening but worth it! These brownies can be frozen after baking.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 ½ cups unsalted butter</li>
            <li>3 cups white sugar</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
            <li>7 eggs, beaten</li>
            <li>1 ¼ cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 ¼ cups unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 pound chopped walnuts</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line one 9x9-inch baking pan<br> with foil and spray with cooking spray.</li>
            <li>In a saucepan over medium-heat, melt butter. Stir in sugar until dissolved.<br> Remove mixture from heat. Gradually pour melted butter into beaten eggs,<br> whisking constantly, until mixture is fully incorporated. Stir in vanilla.</li>
            <li>Sift flour, cocoa, and salt together. Add flour mixture to butter mixture, mixing<br> until combined. Stir in walnuts. Spread batter into the prepared pan.</li>
            <li>Bake in preheated oven until brownies are set (a toothpick inserted in the center<br> should have small crumbs clinging to it, rather than wet batter), 45 to 50<br> minutes. Do not overbake!</li>
        </ol>
